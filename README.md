expression-parser
=================

Examples of expression parsing using Scala parser combinators and expression evaluation using pattern matching.

This code was made to refresh my memory on scala parser combinators, and to demo pattern matching.
It is associated with blog articles at http://www.donroby.com/wp/scala/parsing-expressions-with-scala-parser-combinators-2/
and http://www.donroby.com/wp/scala/pattern-matching-in-scala/ and possibly more in the future.
